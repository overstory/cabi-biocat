The role of the plant-specific family of GRAS-proteins in these processes has become apparent. In this study, the importance of DELLA-proteins has been highlighted and a model of gibberellin-signaling pathways in plants has been shown. The starting point of this model is binding of biologically active gibberellic acid to a receptor and DELLA-protein. Such complex ubiquitinates and becomes a target for proteasomal degradation. The degradation of DELLA-proteins leads to the derepression of plant growth and to a gibberellin response, which is manifested by the induction of growth processes. The molecular functioning mechanisms of DELLA-proteins as transcription factors are discussed.</ab><index><de>gibberellins\growth\plant growth regulators\plant proteins\signal transduction\transcription factors\ubiquitin</de><id>plant growth substances\plant hormones</id><ry>60267-61-0</ry><cc>FF020\FF060\ZZ360</cc><sc>7B\7W\7Q\0P\CA\PL\AA</sc></index><ex>20141111</ex><co>&#109; 2014 CAB International</co></record>
