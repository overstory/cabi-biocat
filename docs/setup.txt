	Steps to setup a new REST service on MarkLogic using the Rest Template pattern

Clone the REST Template library from github.com
	 git clone git@github.com:overstory/rest-template.git
	 This code will be copied into your own source tree later

Create a source tree project for your service
	Example $PROJECTDIR/myservice
		Create subdir appserver-root
		copy everything from the root of the REST Template into the appserver-root directory

MarkLogic Setup
	Decide on a name for the service and its database, example: foobar
	On the Admin screen (127.0.0.1:8001)

	Create a forest, foobar-1 (databases can have multiple forests, this will be the first one)
		All other settings can be left as default, unless you want to specify where the
		forest should be stored.

	Create a database, foobar
		Set the follow non-defaults
			word searches: true
			triple-index: true
			three character searches: true
			trailing wildcards: true
			collection lexicon: true

		Upon hitting OK for database create, the response will prompt you to attach a
		forest.  Select foobar-1 created previously.

	Create an HTTP appserver, port 12000
		name: 12000-foobar
		path: $PROJECTDIR/myservice/appserver-root
		port: 12000
		modules: <filesystem>
		database: foobar
		authentication: application-level (this removes authentication, may be different for deployment)
		default user: admin (may be a less capable user for deployment, but user needs to be able to rewrite URLS and catch errors, admin is usually OK)
		error handler: /xquery/rest/error-handler.xqy
		url rewriter: /xquery/rest/rewriter.xqy

	At this point, you have the generic REST template in scope, point a browser at
	127.0.0.1:12000, you should see a page that says:
		Hi There
                It seems to have worked. Well done.

	You now have a REST service running on MarkLogic.  Next you need to configure the endpoints

Service Setup
	Go to $PROJECTDIR/myservice/appserver-root/xquery/rest and edit the file endpoints.xqy

	Inside is an XML description of endpoints, with Regular Expressions and module paths.  Make
	changes as appropriate to define your desired endpoints.  Detail as to options for endpoint
	definitions can be found here: https://github.com/marklogic/ml-rest-lib

=============

To setup a test-support appserver, follow the above procedure but choose a different name, such as "test-support" and
a different port number.  Set the appserver root path to point to the test support code root.  Set this test appserver
to point to the same database.
